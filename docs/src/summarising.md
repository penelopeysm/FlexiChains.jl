# Summarising

In general a `FlexiChain` contains data in matrices of size `(niters, nchains)`.
Often it is useful to summarise this data along one or both dimensions.

FlexiChains allows you to calculate one or more statistics for each variable stored in a `FlexiChain`.
The result is a `FlexiSummary` object, which can be indexed into in a very similar way to `FlexiChain`s: see [the Indexing page](./indexing.md) for full details, or the examples on this page.

## Unsupported data types

Before we launch into the available summary statistics, it is worth mentioning one point about data types.
Since FlexiChains allows for storage of completely arbitrary data types, it can contain data for which the mean (or other statistic) is not defined.
For example, the mean of `String` values is not defined.
In such cases, the key will be silently dropped from the result, and a warning issued (you can suppress the warning by passing the `warn=false` keyword argument).

If multiple summary statistics are requested (e.g. with [`summarystats`](@ref StatsBase.summarystats)), the key is only dropped if _all_ of them fail.
If at least one statistic is successfully computed for a key, that key will be included in the result, with `missing` values for the statistics that failed.

To give a flavour of how this works, here is an example:

```@example stats
using FlexiChains, Turing

@model function f()
    f ~ Normal()               # float
    v ~ MvNormal(zeros(2), I)  # vector
    s := "a string"            # string
end

chain = sample(f(), MH(), MCMCThreads(), 20, 3; chain_type=VNChain)
```

## Overall summary statistics

If you want a quick overview of what's in your chain, [`summarystats`](@ref StatsBase.summarystats) provides a handy selection of commonly used statistics:

```@docs
StatsBase.summarystats(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain)
```

```@example stats
st = summarystats(chain)
```

Note that in the result, the vector-valued `v` has been broken up into its individual elements `v[1]` and `v[2]`.
This happens automatically for chains with `VarName` keys; you can disable this behaviour by passing `split_varnames=false`.

You can index with a variable name (or names!) and the `stat` dimension:

```@example stats
st[@varname(v[1]), stat=At(:mean)]  # Mean of first element of vector v
```

!!! note "At()"
    Notice to access the _mean_ you have to use `stat=At(:mean)` rather than just `stat=:mean`. This seems a bit verbose, but is actually perfectly consistent with DimensionalData.jl's behaviour: `stat=1` means the first statistic, and `stat=At(:f)` means the statistic with the named index `:f`.

For more details on indexing, please see the [Indexing page](./indexing.md).

## Individual statistics

Sometimes you may only want to calculate a single statistic.

The following functions are all overloaded to accept `FlexiChain` objects.
In all cases, they can be called with `dims=:both`, `dims=:iter`, or `dims=:chain` to specify the dimension over which to compute the statistic; the default is `dims=:both`.

All of these functions return a `FlexiSummary` where the `:stat` dimension has already been collapsed.
That means that if you want to access the mean of a variable `@varname(a)` you don't need to further use the `stat` dimension:

```@example stats
m = mean(chain)
# Not needed: mean_f = m[@varname(f), stat=At(:mean)]
# Just do:
mean_f = m[@varname(f)]
```

```@docs
Statistics.mean(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
Statistics.median(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
Statistics.std(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
Statistics.var(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
Statistics.quantile(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain, p; kwargs...)
Base.minimum(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
Base.maximum(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
Base.sum(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
Base.prod(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
MCMCDiagnosticTools.ess(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
MCMCDiagnosticTools.rhat(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
MCMCDiagnosticTools.mcse(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
StatsBase.mad(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
StatsBase.geomean(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
StatsBase.harmmean(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
StatsBase.iqr(::FlexiChains.FlexiChain; kwargs...)
```

For highest density intervals and equal-tailed intervals, you will need to load `PosteriorStats` as these are defined in an extension.

## Custom statistics

There are two scenarios where the above are not enough:

1. you want to calculate a specific set of statistics that is not the same as what `summarystats` does; or
2. you want to calculate a completely custom statistic, which is not implemented above.

In both cases, you can directly use [`FlexiChains.collapse`] to achieve this.
(But in the latter case, please do also consider opening an issue so that we can implement it!)

```@docs
FlexiChains.collapse
```

As an example, suppose you have a statistic that calculates the sum of the mean and standard deviation.
(This is of course quite contrived: if you have a _real_ example, again, please do open an issue!)

We start by defining our own function:

```@example stats
using Statistics

function mean_std_sum(x::AbstractVector{<:Real})
    return mean(x) + std(x)
end
```

As noted in the docstring of [`FlexiChains.collapse`](@ref), the function you provide must accept a vector argument and return a single value.
Of course, it can also have other methods, but this is the one which `collapse` uses.

Now we can use `collapse` to apply this function to all variables in the chain.
The second argument is a vector, which in this case will only contain our one function:

```@example stats
custom_stat = FlexiChains.collapse(chain, [mean_std_sum]; dims=:both)
```

There are two things worth mentioning, which we will note in passing here without demonstrating (since they are also covered in the docstring):

1. If there is only one function provided, you can additionally pass `drop_stat_dim=true` to remove the `:stat` dimension from the result, much like what `mean(chain)` et al. do.

2. The name of the statistic is inferred from the function. Sometimes this doesn't work out nicely, for example if you pass an anonymous function. In this case you can provide a tuple of `(:name, function)` instead of just the function.
