By default, dims is :both, which collapses both the iteration and chain dimensions. Other valid values are :iter or :chain, which  respectively collapse only the iteration or chain dimension.\n\nThe functions in funcs must map an (NIter × NChains) matrix to:\n\na single item if dims=:both;\na (1 × NChains) matrix if dims=:iter;\nan (NIter × 1) matrix if dims=:chain.\n\nThis means that the exact function used will differ depending on the value of dims. For example, suppose that chn is a FlexiChain. Then the following are all valid:\n\nusing FlexiChains: collapse\nusing Statistics: mean, std\n\ncollapse(chn, [mean, std]; dims=:both)\ncollapse(chn, [x -> mean(x; dims=1), x -> std(x; dims=1)]; dims=:iter)\ncollapse(chn, [x -> mean(x; dims=2), x -> std(x; dims=2)]; dims=:chain)\n\nNote that, in the latter two cases, the inferred statistic name will not be mean or std but rather some unintelligible name of an anonymous function. This is why it is recommended to use the (statistic_name::Symbol, func::Function) tuple form in these cases, such as in the following:\n\ncollapse(chn, [\n    (:mean, x -> mean(x; dims=1)),\n    (:std, x -> std(x; dims=1))\n]; dims=:iter)\n\nIf a statistic function errors when applied to a key, that key is skipped and a warning is issued.

For more flexibility, you can use FlexiChains.collapse to apply one or more summary functions to a FlexiChain.\n\nUsers should not need to construct FlexiSummary objects directly.\n\nIndexing\n\nA FlexiSummary{TKey} can be indexed into using exactly the same techniques as a FlexiChain{TKey}. That is to say:\n\nwith Parameter{TKey} or Extra to unambiguously get the summary statistics for that key\nwith TKey for automatic conversion to Parameter{TKey}\nwith Symbol to find unambiguous matches\nif TKey<:VarName, using VarName or sub-VarNames to additionally extract part of the data.\n\nThe returned value will be either a DimensionalData.DimArray (if there are one or more non-collapsed dimensions), or a single value (if all dimensions are collapsed).\n\nIf a DimArray is returned, the dimensions that you will see are: :iter (if the summary function was only applied over chains), :chain (same but for iterations), and :stat (typically seen when multiple summary functions were applied).\n\nExtended help\n\nInternal data layout\n\nA FlexiSummary, much like a FlexiChain, contains a mapping of keys to arrays of data. However, the dimensions of a FlexiSummary are substantially different. In particular:\n\nThe :iter and/or :chain dimensions may have been collapsed via the act of calculating a summary over iterations or chains.\nThere is an additional, third, dimension: the statistic dimension, represented by `:stat. This dimension records which statistic(s) have been calculated.\nThe :stat dimension may also have been collapsed. This can happen if only one statistic was computed and drop_stat_dim=true was used when calling FlexiChains.collapse. The purpose of this is to avoid making the user deal with a redundant singleton dimension when calling a function such as mean(chain).\n\nRegardless of which dimensions have been collapsed, the internal data of a FlexiSummary always contains all three dimensions (some of which may have size 1).\n\nInformation about which dimensions are collapsed is therefore not stored in the arrays. Instead, it is stored in the _iter_indices, _chain_indices, and _stat_indices fields of the FlexiSummary, as well as their types. If any of these are nothing, then that dimension has been collapsed.\n\nThis information is later used in the _get_raw_data and _raw_to_user_data functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"turing/#Usage-with-Turing.jl","page":"Usage with Turing.jl","title":"Usage with Turing.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"turing/","page":"Usage with Turing.jl","title":"Usage with Turing.jl","text":"This page describes how to use FlexiChains from the perspective of a Turing.jl user.","category":"page"},{"location":"turing/","page":"Usage with Turing.jl","title":"Usage with Turing.jl","text":"In particular, it does not explain 'under the hood' how FlexiChains works.

Consider, e.g., the predict(::Model, ::MCMCChains.Chains) function, which is used to sample from the posterior predictive distribution. This requires one to extract the values from the chain and insert them back into the model (or technically the VarInfo).\nHowever, in general one cannot reconstruct a vector x from its constituent elements x[1], x[2], ... as we do not know the appropriate length of the vector! The current implementation of this function in DynamicPPL.jl thus has to, essentially, insert all the elements it can find and hope for the best.\nEssentially, MCMCChains' data structure forces packages like Turing.jl and DynamicPPL.jl to include workarounds to deal with the limitations of the chains package.\nTo create a robust and readable codebase.\nMuch Julia code is written with the intention of efficiency or versatility, often sacrificing clarity in the process. This is usually acceptable when creating simple scripts. However, I believe that library code should be held to a (much) higher standard.\nIn particular, I consider the overuse of multiple dispatch to be a major source of confusion in Julia code. Types cannot be fully inferred at compile time (and even when they can, it requires packages such as JET.jl, which do not (yet) have convenient language server integrations). This means that when reading code, one cannot easily determine which method is being called.\nA prime example is the Chains constructor in MCMCChains.jl. methods(Chains) returns 11 methods, and each time you see a call to Chains(...) you need to figure out which of these 11 it is. In writing FlexiChains I have made a conscious choice to create only two inner constructors for FlexiChain.","category":"page"},{"location":"whynew/","page":"Why a new package?","title":"Why a new package?","text":"In particular, notice that performance is not one of my considerations. In my opinion, performance is only a minor concern for FlexiChains.jl, because the main bottleneck in Bayesian inference is the sampling, not how fast one can construct or index into a chain.","category":"page"}]
