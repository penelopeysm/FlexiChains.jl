Consider, e.g., the predict(::Model, ::MCMCChains.Chains) function, which is used to sample from the posterior predictive distribution. This requires one to extract the values from the chain and insert them back into the model (or technically the VarInfo).\nHowever, in general one cannot reconstruct a vector x from its constituent elements x[1], x[2], ... as we do not know the appropriate length of the vector! The current implementation of this function in DynamicPPL.jl thus has to, essentially, insert all the elements it can find and hope for the best.\nEssentially, MCMCChains' data structure forces packages like Turing.jl and DynamicPPL.jl to include workarounds to deal with the limitations of the chains package.\nTo create a robust and readable codebase.\nMuch Julia code is written with the intention of efficiency or versatility, often sacrificing clarity in the process. This is usually acceptable when creating simple scripts. However, I believe that library code should be held to a (much) higher standard.\nIn particular, I consider the overuse of multiple dispatch to be a major source of confusion in Julia code. Types cannot be fully inferred at compile time (and even when they can, it requires packages such as JET.jl, which do not (yet) have convenient language server integrations). This means that when reading code, one cannot easily determine which method is being called.\nA prime example is the Chains constructor in MCMCChains.jl. methods(Chains) returns 11 methods, and each time you see a call to Chains(...) you need to figure out which of these 11 it is.
